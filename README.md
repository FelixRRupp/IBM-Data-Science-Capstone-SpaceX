# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-SpaceX
## Introduction
In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. In this module, you will be provided with an overview of the problem and the tools you need to complete the course.

## Project Overview
In this capstone project, participants will explore a real-world scenario where data science can provide substantial business value. The primary focus is on developing predictive models to ascertain the likelihood of a successful landing of Falcon 9's first stage, utilizing various data science and machine learning techniques. This project not only enhances your technical skills but also deepens your understanding of how these skills can be applied to solve complex industry challenges.

## Learning Objectives
- Develop Python code to manipulate data in a Pandas DataFrame**: Learn to perform data manipulation tasks effectively using one of the most popular data manipulation packages in Python.
- Convert a JSON file into a Pandas DataFrame
- Create and share a Jupyter Notebook using GitHub
- Apply data science methodologies to define and solve a business problem
- Utilize data analysis tools to load, clean, and analyze datasets

## Tech-Stack
- Python: The primary programming language used for all coding activities, including data manipulation and model building.
- Pandas & JSON: Key libraries for data manipulation and format conversion.
- Jupyter Notebook: The preferred IDE for writing Python code, analyzing data, and sharing findings.
- GitHub: Used for version control and sharing of the Jupyter Notebooks for collaboration and review.

## Conclusion
This capstone project provides a comprehensive platform to apply our data science skills to a practical industry problem. By predicting the landing success of SpaceX's Falcon 9, we will not only contribute to cost-saving strategies but also prepare to tackle similar challenges in the aerospace industry and beyond.
